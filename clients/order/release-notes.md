- Release date
  - October 22, 2021
- Jira release
  - [Order Client 2021.42.0](https://briggo.atlassian.net/projects/RS2/versions/10134/tab/release-report-all-issues)

### Overview

In this release we set up a Storybook development environment with automated deployment, and implemented the first iteration of application features.

Iteration 1 of rapid prototype development of the Order client includes navigation of placeholder views for the full scope of the Order experience. A hybrid of route-based and state-based navigation realistically implements how the application will respond to user interaction as well as changes in state from events from the cloud.
