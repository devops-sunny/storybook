- Jira release
  - [Marquee Client 2021.42.0](https://briggo.atlassian.net/projects/RS2/versions/10136/tab/release-report-all-issues)

### Overview

In this release we set up a Storybook development environment with automated deployment, and implemented the first iteration of application features.

Iteration 1 of rapid prototype development of the Marquee client includes navigation of placeholder views for the full scope of the Marquee experience. State-based navigation realistically implements how the application will respond to changes in state from events and sensors in the kiosk and from the cloud.
